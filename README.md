<h1>Proxmox VM Server Lab Install</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of installing and setting up the Proxmox Virtual Machine Server. Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is an open-source server virtualization platform that allows you to manage and deploy virtual machines (VMs) and containers within a single integrated solution. It combines the benefits of virtualization and containerization, offering features like live migration, high availability, clustering, and a web-based interface for ease of administration. Proxmox VE supports various virtualization technologies, including KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for full virtualization and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight virtualization, providing flexibility and efficiency in managing your virtualized infrastructure. The computer used is an older intel computer with 16 cores of CPU and 8Gb of ram (I know, I will upgrade soon)
